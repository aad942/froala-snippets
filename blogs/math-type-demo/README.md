# Formatting Math Expressions Example

This repository uses Froala together with a Wiris MathType integration for formatting mathematical or chemical expressions. Using this setup, end users can perform mathematical formatting by interacting with a user-friendly interface instead of typing math markup like LaTeX or MathML. 

---

## Features

- **Mathematical Formatting**: Write mathematical symbols, expressions, and equations, from basic arithmetic to integrals, matrices, and entire proofs.
- **Chemical Expressions**: Have users that deal with Chemistry instead of Math? This setup also handles that, from chemical symbols to balancing and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, responsive layout with organized and readable math output.

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you will need:

1. Your preferred web stack (in this case, just HTML and CSS).
2. Froala Editor (at least version 3 is required).
3. Wiris MathType files (see instructions below).

## How to Run

### 1. Create your application directory

 
### 2. Download Wiris MathType files

- Clone this repository into your project folder.
- Open CMD or your chocie of terminal and run the following command into your directory: `npm install @wiris/mathtype-froala3`

### 3. Run the application

### How It Works

1. Click the square root icon for math formatting or the C icon for chemical formatting.
2. Type your expressions in the popup MathType editor.
3. Click "OK" once you finish editing. The math output will be displayed on the Froala Editor.
