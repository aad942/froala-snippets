# File Upload, Document-Ready, and Rich Content Examples

This repository uses Froala Editor to demonstrate advanced file uploads, a document-ready mode (like in Google Docs), and rich content insertion. Using this setup, end users can upload files and transform them (or even process them after the upload), add emojis, tables, and other symbols, and use the editor mode that best fits document processing use cases. 

---

## Features

- **File Uploads and Management**: Upload files easily using Filestack's file picker, natively integrated into Froala Editor.
- **Rich Content**: Insert tables, emojis, symbols, horizontal lines, and similar content that goes beyond text.
- **Document-Ready Mode**: Edit content in a way that is similar to other word processors like Google Docs or MS Word.
